## Objective

It's time to build fluency in JavaScript Requests. In this next Pro Project, we're going to practice making API calls in JavaScript so you can hone your skills and feel confident taking them to the real world.

Using fetch, async, and await, you'll request information from the [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/) and [APIXU](https://www.apixu.com/doc/) to create a travel website.
